codeFileGuide.txt -- this file should help interpret the contents of code and helper documents that are referenced in my FRC Java queries which will be contained in my FRC Java Collection.

letter 's' at end of word, to indicate multiple of a thing, is often omitted.
many document contain abbreviation for longer terms, with or without a terminal period (.) e.g. ref for reference, w/o for without, and the usual latin abbrev.: v. for vide, cf. for compare... In code docs, names of things may be abbrev. in comment: rI instead of robotInit, tP for teleopPeriodic, rP for robotPeriodic, rC for RobotContainer, [file name].j for a Java code doc, the char * for any character(s), / for a path separator,  | for an 'or' between list items, etc. bracket pair [ ] may indicate an as yet unknown variable; options for it can be separated by | symbols within the brackets.

a 'code document' is a formatted text file, which for these queries will normally be a .java file type. Java code for FRC is most often found deeply in the path tree of a Visual Studio Code (IDE from Microsoft customized by the WPILib code masters) project folder. this IDE will be abbre. VScode here.

for the files ending in .java, the required Java syntax should be followed. If you see code lines containing violations of required syntax, then, if possible, you should put corrected code in their place, and explain why the correction was appropriate in a comment added before the corrected code. If correction by you not possible, write a comment explaining the problem and how it should be addressed by the human programmer. 

'comment' within a code document is text that explains | questions | criticizes the code that follows it. comment could contain useful metadata about the following code, to indicate its purpose, reason for having the current form, the meaning of a compile error returned by VScode, or other to or from the code writer.

a 'helper document' could have postfix of .txt |.html | .md | .shtml | .pdf and does not require any particular formatting but if it's long and you want to call attention to a particular section, some char. (e.g. // or /*  */ pair) of your choice can be used to prefix your comment.

comment text is formatted differently according to the convention of the code language. example: one character set like // for one line comment, or a start-end  /*  */ char. pair or <!-- --> for multi-line comment. In a helper document, a topic HEADING in all upper case should state the significance of the following text, possibly formatted code, and thus provides an indexing key for finding that text.


useful context sources for these FRC Java queries, in addition to those specified with each new query thread, will be found in other threads in my FRC Java Collection.

Java code for FRC robotics may only execute properly if a series of components, soft- and hardware, are version compatible. Unfortunately during the extended FRC build season (yearly Dec - Apr.) their code masters typically make repeated updates to device firmware, coding tools, NI Game Tools, etc. Therefore the year of creation, e.g. '23 (indicating 2023 build season) will often be relevant to functionality, and should be specified, when known, in the file descriptors, which are described next
  
doc (code and helper) descriptors:
sourceType: mostly nouns with optional modifier, e.g. template, example, fragment, framework, vendor, project, robot, command, subsystem, aux, helper, prototype, [number representing software / hardware compatibility] ...
sourceStatus: mostly adjective, e.g. functional, untested, in progress, local, final, archive ...
sourceContext: mostly noun, e.g. project name, robot type, number (date created), season (year) valid, purpose of code | helper doc
